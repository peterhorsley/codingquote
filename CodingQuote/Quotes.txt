Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small trivial project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you do, you’ll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the sheer size of the work you envision. So start small, and think about the details. Don’t think about some big picture and fancy design. If it doesn’t solve some fairly immediate need, it’s almost certainly over-designed. And don’t expect people to jump in and help you. That’s not how these things work. You need to get something half-way useful first, and then others will say "hey, that almost works for me", and they’ll get involved in the project.

Q: What is the most often-overlooked risk in software engineering? A: Incompetent programmers. There are estimates that the number of programmers needed in the U.S. exceeds 200,000. This is entirely misleading. It is not a quantity problem; we have a quality problem. One bad programmer can easily create two new jobs a year. Hiring more bad programmers will just increase our perceived need for them. If we had more good programmers, and could easily identify them, we would need fewer, not more.

For a sucessful technology, honesty must take precedence over public relations for nature cannot be fooled.
- Richard Feynman

Comparing to another activity is useful if it helps you formulate questions, it’s dangerous when you use it to justify answers.
- Martin Fowler

Simplicity carried to the extreme becomes elegance.
- Jon Franklin

Software obeys the law of gaseous expansion – it continues to grow until memory is completely filled.
- Larry Gleason

The unavoidable price of reliability is simplicity.
- C.A.R. Hoare

Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats much of the purpose of using one.
- Kernighan and Plauger, The Elements of Programming Style.

You’re bound to be unhappy if you optimize everything.
- Donald Knuth

A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable.
- Leslie Lamport

But in our enthusiasm, we could not resist a radical overhaul of the system, in which all of its major weaknesses have been exposed, analyzed, and replaced with new weaknesses.
- Bruce Leverett, Register Allocation in Optimizing Compilers

The proper use of comments is to compensate for our failure to express ourself in code.
- Robert C. Martin / Clean Code

If you want a product with certain characteristics, you must ensure that the team has those characteristics before the product’s development.
- Jim McCarthy and Michele McCarthy – Software for your Head

You can’t have great software without a great team, and most software teams behave like dysfunctional families.
- Jim McCarthy

Testing by itself does not improve software quality. Test results are an indicator of quality, but in and of themselves, they don’t improve it. Trying to improve software quality by increasing the amount of testing is like trying to lose weight by weighing yourself more often. What you eat before you step onto the scale determines how much you will weigh, and the software development techniques you use determine how many errors testing will find. If you want to lose weight, don’t buy a new scale; change your diet. If you want to improve your software, don’t test more; develop better.
- Steve McConnell Code Complete

Correctness is clearly the prime quality. If a system does not do what it is supposed to do, then everything else about it matters little.
- Bertrand Meyer

Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation.
- Bertrand Meyer

Software sucks because users demand it to.

There’s no sense being exact about something if you don’t even know what you’re talking about.
- John von Neumann

That’s the thing about people who think they hate computers. What they really hate is lousy programmers.
- Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle Oath of Fealty

Search all the parks in all your cities; you’ll find no statues of committees.
- David Ogilvy

Good code is short, simple, and symmetrical – the challenge is figuring out how to get there.
- Sean Parent

It is a painful thing to look at your own trouble and know that you yourself and no one else has made it.
- Sophocles, Ajax

The primary duty of an exception handler is to get the error out of the lap of the programmer and into the surprised face of the user. Provided you keep this cardinal rule in mind, you can’t go far wrong.
- Verity Stob

A notation is important for what it leaves out.
- Joseph Stoy

An organisation that treats its programmers as morons will soon have programmers that are willing and able to act like morons only.
- Bjarne Stroustrup

I have always wished that my computer would be as easy to use as my telephone. My wish has come true. I no longer know how to use my telephone.
- Bjarne Stroustrup

The most important single aspect of software development is to be clear about what you are trying to build.
- Bjarne Stroustrup

The best is the enemy of the good.
- Voltaire

As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn’t as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.
- Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging, 1949

Software gets slower faster than hardware gets faster.
- Wirth’s law

The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it.
- Dr. Pamela Zave

I object to doing things that computers can do.
- Olin Shivers

Simplicity — the art of maximizing the amount of work not done — is essential.
- From the Agile Manifesto.

When you want to do something differently from the rest of the world, it’s a good idea to look into whether the rest of the world knows something you don’t.
- unknown

Complexity has nothing to do with intelligence, simplicity does.
- Larry Bossidy

If it doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter how fast it doesn’t work.
- Mich Ravera

Simplicity is hard to build, easy to use, and hard to charge for. Complexity is easy to build, hard to use, and easy to charge for.
- Chris Sacca

... what society overwhelmingly asks for is snake oil. Of course, the snake oil has the most impressive names — otherwise you would be selling nothing — like "Structured Analysis and Design", "Software Engineering", "Maturity Models", "Management Information Systems", "Integrated Project Support Environments" "Object Orientation" and "Business Process Re-engineering" (the latter three being known as IPSE, OO and BPR, respectively).
- Edsger W. Dijkstra — EWD 1175: The strengths of the academic enterprise [Today we could add ‘Extreme Programming’, ‘Agile Software Development’ and many more.]

They won’t tell you that they don’t understand it; they will happily invent their way through the gaps and obscurities.
- V.A. Vyssotsky on software programmers and their views on specifications

In software, the most beautiful code, the most beautiful functions, and the most beautiful programs are sometimes not there at all.
- Jon Bentley, Beautiful Code (O'Reilly), "The Most Beautiful Code I Never Wrote"

Computers make it easier to do a lot of things, but most of the things they make it easier to do don’t need to be done.
- Andy Rooney

True glory consists in doing what deserves to be written; in writing what deserves to be read.
- Pliny the Elder

The whole point of getting things done is knowing what to leave undone.
- Oswald Chambers

The whole HTML validation exercise is questionable, but validating as XHTML is flat-out masochism. Only recommended for those that enjoy pain. Or programmers. I can’t always tell the difference.
- Jeff Atwood

When in doubt, leave it out.
- Joshua Bloch

No code is faster than no code.
- merb motto

As a rule, software systems do not work well until they have been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications.
- Dave Parnas

OOP is to writing a program, what going through airport security is to flying.
- Richard Mansfield

The problem with object-oriented languages is they’ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.
- Joe Armstrong

As a programmer, it is your job to put yourself out of business. What you do today can be automated tomorrow.
- Doug McIlroy

IDE features are language smells.
- Reg Braithwaite

PHP is [the] Sarah Palin of programming languages.
- killerstorm

A good way to have good ideas is by being unoriginal.
- Bram Cohen

The comment about developers making work for themselves is also spot on. I answer a lot of programming questions, and the questions are always asked because the programmer has reached the end of a twisty maze of his own creation. Turn around, walk, spin around, and try again. You’ll find a better solution.
- Jonathan Rockway in a Hacker News comment

The trick is to fix the problem you have, rather than the problem you want.
- Bram Cohen

Security is a state of mind.
- NSA Security Manual

Never attribute to funny hardware that which can be adequately explained by broken locking.
- Erik Quanstrom

Things which any idiot could write usually have the quality of having been written by an idiot.
- Bram Cohen

In programming the hard part isn’t solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve.
- Paul Graham

[POSIX] unifying unix? more like formalizing historical design mistakes made by major vendors...

Do I really want to be using a language where memoize is a PhD-level topic?
- Mark Engelberg about Haskell

If you start programming by learning perl you will just become a menace to yourself and others.
- egoncasteel

When there is no type hierarchy you don’t have to manage the type hierarchy.
- Rob Pike

Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.
- RnRS

Software efficiency halves every 18 months, compensating Moore’s Law.
- May’s Law

So-called "smart" software usually is the worst you can imagine.
- Christian Neukirchen

Such is modern computing: everything simple is made too complicated because it’s easy to fiddle with; everything complicated stays complicated because it’s hard to fix.
- Rob Pike

It is not that uncommon for the cost of an abstraction to outweigh the benefit it delivers. Kill one today!
- John Carmack

So much complexity in software comes from trying to make one thing do two things.
- Ryan Singer

The standard rule is, when you’re in a hole, stop digging; that seems not to apply [to] software nowadays.
- Ron Minnich

Languages that try to disallow idiocy become themselves idiotic.
- Rob Pike

There’s nothing in computing that can’t be broken by another level of indirection.
- Rob Pike

A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work.
- John Gall

"design patterns" are concepts used by people who can’t learn by any method except memorization, so in place of actual programming ability, they memorize "patterns" and throw each one in sequence at a problem until it works
- Dark_Shikari

One of the big lessons of a big project is you don’t want people that aren’t really programmers programming, you’ll suffer for it!
- John Carmack

Premature optimization, that’s like a sneeze. Premature abstraction is like ebola; it makes my eyes bleed.
- Christer Ericson

Premature optimizations can be troublesome to revert, but premature generalizations are often near impossible.
- Emil Persson

Premature optimization, that’s like a fart. Premature abstraction is like taking a dump on another developer’s desk.
- Chris Eric

Normal people believe that if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Engineers believe that if it ain’t broke, it doesn’t have enough features yet.
- Scott Adams

If you give someone a program, you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program, you will frustrate them for a lifetime.
- David Leinweber (NOWS)

And don’t EVER make the mistake that you can design something better than what you get from ruthless massively parallel trial-and-error with a feedback cycle. That’s giving your intelligence much too much credit.
- Linus
